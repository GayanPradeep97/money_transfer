              Changes to this agreement
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We will from time to time need to change the terms of this
                  Agreement. We can anticipate some of the reasons why it d be
                  fair for us to do this, and have listed them below, but may in
                  the future also want to make changes for other reasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We can make a change to this Agreement for any reason
                  (including the following), with any change being a reasonable
                  and proportionate response to a change that is affecting us or
                  that we reasonably think will affect us:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      because of a change in Applicable Laws, for example we may
                      have to change our requirements for keeping your Currency
                      Account safe to meet new, higher standards set by law;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      if the change benefits you, for example when introducing
                      new products or services or improving existing ones;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      to reflect a change in our costs of running your Currency
                      Account or providing you with related services, for
                      example by introducing a new fee;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      in response to possible risks to the security of your
                      Currency Account, for example by changing the security
                      steps you need to follow to access your Account or submit
                      an Order; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      to respond to any other change that affects us, if it s
                      fair to pass on the effects of the change to you, for
                      example to reflect developments in digital payments.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  We may make changes for any other reason we cannot foresee,
                  for example to respond to changes among our competitors that
                  affect how we wish to deliver our services to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We shall notify you of any change to this Agreement in writing
                  (either by post or email). The proposed variation shall come
                  into effect automatically on the date stated in our notice,
                  such date to be at least two (2) months after the date of
                  receipt of the notice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can then tell us at cs@spoton.money that you wish to end
                  this Agreement (and close your Currency Account) before the
                  change takes effect; otherwise, you ll be treated as having
                  accepted the change.

                  you shall:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      immediately make payment in full for all pending Trades

                    <li>
                      except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement
                      and subject to any rights or obligations which have
                      accrued prior to termination, neither party shall have any

                      deduct from the Currency Account all fees and other
                      amounts owing under this Agreement and transfer any
                      remaining funds to your nominated bank account (without
                      prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement).

                </li>
                <li>
                  The termination of this Agreement shall not affect any

                  necessary implication intended to survive such termination.

              The currency Account
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Your Currency Account is an electronic money account which
                  enables you to send and receive electronic payments in
                  accordance with the terms of this Clause 12.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your Currency Account is not a personal bank or deposit
                  account and you will not earn any interest on the funds held
                  in the Currency Account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As the provider of your Currency Account, we are authorised by
                  the Financial Conduct Authority under the SPI (FRN: 510848) as
                  a small Payment Institution, which allow us to provide payment
                  services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As a payment institution, we are required to ensure that
                  customer funds are appropriately “safeguarded”. This means
                  that funds received by us corresponding to electronic money
                  will be held in one or more segregated bank accounts
                  separately from our own funds, in accordance with the EMRs. In
                  the event of our insolvency, these funds will form an asset
                  pool which is separate from our insolvent estate and an
                  administrator will be entitled to reimburse you from this pool
                  (in priority to other creditors).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your Currency Account(s) are denominated in the currency as

              Using the currency account
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We will credit any funds received from you to your Currency
                  Account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your Currency Account can be used to:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      store funds in a currency nominated by you in your
                      Application Form;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      make Transfers (alone or in combination with a Trade);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      make Payment in connection with one or more Trades; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      make any payment of Margin in accordance with Clause 19.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will not allow you to make any Transfer or Payment Out of
                  your Currency Account where this would put your Currency
                  Account into a negative balance. You should therefore ensure
                  that you have sufficient funds, including in respect of Margin
                  Calls which may be made from time-to-time, in your Account
                  before placing an Order.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We may apply spending limits on your Currency Account (for
                  example, the maximum amount of Transfers or Trades that you
                  can make in one day or the maximum exposure you can have to a
                  single currency), and we ll tell you if we do so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We do not impose fees or charges for our Services save for
                  same-currency Transfers or Trades, where we may impose a
                  reasonable charge which we will negotiate with you. We will
                  let you know of our fees in advance of accepting any Trades or
                  Transfers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, others might impose fees, charges or taxes. For
                  example, a correspondent bank who is involved in processing
                  your Transfer charge you a fee to transmit funds to the
                  Beneficiary Account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The exchange rates we use are variable exchange rates which
                  are changing constantly throughout the day (for example, to
                  reflect movements in foreign exchange markets). The exchange
                  rate applied to your payments will appear on your statement.
                  Unless otherwise agreed with you, the exchange rate we will
                  apply to Transfers (including any future dated payments) and
                  Trades which are in a different currency to the denomination
                  of your Currency Account will be the rate applicable at the
                  time that your payment is processed. You can contact us to
                  find out the rate which will apply by contacting your SpotOn
                  Representative.

                  You can place an Order from your Currency Account online, by

                    <li>
                      Online: You must log on to the Online System (using your
                      password and log-in details) and follow the instructions
                      to submit your Order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Telephone: You must call an SpotOn Representative and
                      specify your Order, together with such other information
                      as we may reasonably request.
                    </li>
                    <li>Email: You must email us and specify your Order.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you confirm an Order (and make Payment in accordance with
                  Clause 18) on a non-Business Day (or after our cut off times
                  (which we shall make available on our website)), we ll process
                  your Transfer on the next Business Day.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will send the funds to the Beneficiary Account nominated by
                  you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the Beneficiary Account is held in the EEA and is in pounds
                  sterling (£), euro (€) or another EEA currency, the account
                  provider (e.g. bank) will receive the money by the end of the
                  next Business Day after you ask us to send it. Otherwise, if
                  the Beneficiary Account is held in the EEA (and the
                  transaction is in a non-EEA currency), the account provider
                  will receive the money within four Business Days after you ask
                  us to send it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the account provider is in the EEA and the Beneficiary
                  Account is in an EEA currency, the account provider is
                  required by law to put the money into the Beneficiary Account
                  as soon as it receives it. Banking practices may vary if you
                  send money to a non-EEA currency account or to an account
                  outside the EEA - for more information on when a payment will
                  be credited to such an account, you can ask us the Beneficiary
                  Account provider.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a Transfer you asked us to make within the EEA does not
                  arrive when it should have, you can ask us to contact the
                  Beneficiary Account provider and ask them to treat it as if it
                  was made on any time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Beneficiary s account provider may apply its own charges
                  to the Transfer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Where you make Payment using your Currency Account, the amount
                  of the Payment will be deducted by us from your Currency
                  Account balance. You must ensure that you have sufficient
                  funds in your Currency Account to cover the amount of any
                  Trade or Transfer you want to make using the Account. If you
                  do not have sufficient funds in your Currency Account, we
                  reserve the right to postpone the execution date of the Trade
                  or Transfer and we may impose a charge to cover the costs of
                  us doing so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will make available to you through the Online System key
                  information relating to all transactions on your Currency
                  Account and a transaction history at any time and such
                  information may also be downloaded as a report which can be
                  stored and reproduced in an unchanged manner.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each transaction made using the Currency Account will be given
                  a unique transaction ID which will be set out in the
                  transaction history. You must quote this transaction ID when
                  communicating with a SpotOn Representative about a particular
                  transaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unless we agree otherwise, we ll provide you with statements
                  every month and free of charge, provided that there have been
                  payment transactions on the account during the month.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any redemption from the Currency Account will be to the bank
                  account which you notified to us when you first registered to
                  use our Services and you can request a redemption through the

                      If there is a defective or non-executed transaction to or
                      from the Currency Account, we will without undue delay
                      refund the amount of a payment and any charges you have
                      paid as a result, subject to the other provisions of this
                      Clause 14.

                    <li>
                      We will not be liable if the error was caused by the
                      sender s payment service provider (for a payment to the
                      Currency Account) or the Beneficiary s payment service

                  this Agreement, or under general law. We shall pay to you all
                  or part of any amount of Margin owed to us by you (e.g. upon
                  fulfilment of a Trade) under this clause to the extent that we
                  consider, in our discretion, that the amount of Margin you
                  have transferred to us exceeds the amount required by us to
                  secure or cover all your present or future, actual or
                  contingent, or prospective obligations to us under this
                  Agreement or otherwise.

                  Date or to extend (roll over) the Delivery Date in relation to
                  the whole or only part of your Forward Contract. We may agree
                  to such a request entirely at our discretion. If we agree, you
                  acknowledge that we may adjust the Payment Amount to reflect
                  new Delivery Date.

                      rates. If the value of the Purchase Currency has
                      strengthened, this means that a loss will be incurred on

                      agree that we may immediately deduct the total amount of
                      any loss (together with any costs) from your Currency

                      you must pay the balance within seven (7) days of being

          <div className="content-figure">
            <div className="content-item">
              <h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>
              <p>
                This Data Protection Policy (the “Policy”) sets out the policy
                which Monex International Limited (referred to as “we” or “us”
                in this document) has adopted in order to facilitate compliance
                with the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) when we
                establish and manage customer relationships and execute
                transactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The GDPR regulates the “processing” of “personal data”. Its
                definition of “personal data” covers all information relating to
                identifiable living individuals which is held on computer, in
                other automatically-processable form or in a manual filing
                system which is structured so as to facilitate access to
                information relating to particular individuals. (Information
                relating to companies and other “legal” persons is not caught).
                Its definition of “processing” covers any conceivable activity
                in relation to personal data, including collection, analysis,
                processing in the ordinary sense of the word, storage,
                disclosure, international transfer and deletion.
              </p>
              <p>
                We process personal data in various circumstances and in
                relation to various categories of individual. This Policy deals
                specifically with personal data collected in the context of the
                establishment and management of our customer relationships and
                the execution of transactions on the instructions of our
                customers (“Customer and/or Transaction Management”). It does
                not, for example, deal with data protection issues which might
                arise in relation to our HR or direct marketing activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                It should be borne in mind that the GDPR regulates processing of
                personal data relating to all individuals, not just relating to
                customers. Information relating to individual representatives of
                corporate customers, or to individuals (or individual
                representatives of corporates) elsewhere in a payment chain -
                for example, an ultimate payee or an individual representative
                of an aggregator - is also protected by the GDPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The individuals to whom personal data relate, whether customers
                or otherwise, are known as “data subjects”.
              </p>
              <p>
                The UK Information Commissioner (the “Commissioner”) is
                responsible for enforcement of the GDPR and has published a
                range of guidance on data protection issues, all of which is
                available on the Commissioner s website at www.ico.gov.uk.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our principal obligations under the GDPR include: (i) processing
                personal data fairly, legitimately, lawfully and
                proportionately; (ii) informing individuals regarding our
                processing of their personal data; (iii) abiding by restrictions
                on the international transfer of personal data; (iv) keeping
                personal data secure, taking steps to ensure that they are
                accurate and up-to-date and deleting them when they are no
                longer needed; (v) maintaining an appropriate registration with
                the Commissioner s office; and (vi) responding appropriately
                when data subjects seek to exercise their statutory rights of
                access, correction and objection.
              </p>
              <p>

                International Limited. The requirements set out in this Policy

                Customer and/or Transaction Management procedure involving the
                processing of personal data, we must take these requirements
                into account and ensure that they are met.
              </p>
              <p>
                We expect that our routine processing of personal data for
                Customer and/or Transaction Management procedure will generally
                meet the most general of the available conditions, which is
                known as the “legitimate interests” condition. The legitimate
                interests condition will apply, and allow us to process personal
                data, if both:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate
                  interests that we, or a person to whom we disclose the data,
                  pursue (these may be business, compliance or other purposes);
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  the processing is not “unwarranted” because it prejudices the
                  rights, freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each processing operation should, therefore, be assessed to
                ensure that part A of this condition is met - i.e. we have a
                legitimate business, compliance or other purpose for carrying
                out the processing. If part A is met, you should then consider
                whether the processing will prejudice the data subjects in any
                way - our expectation is that, provided the other rules in this
                Policy are followed, our ordinary processing for Customer and/or
                Transaction Management purposes will not prejudice data subjects
                rights, freedoms or legitimate interests. If you consider that
                there is a potential for prejudice to be caused in a particular
                case, the prejudice should be balanced against our interests and
                a view taken on whether our interests outweigh the prejudice to
                the data subjects.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are in any doubt as to whether the legitimate interests
                condition is met, you should consider whether the processing can
                be justified on the basis that it meets any of the other
                statutory conditions available in the GDPR. The other conditions
                most likely to apply are as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                Processing is justified if it is necessary to fulfil a UK legal
                obligation. This will include, for example, processing in order
                to carry out legally-required anti-money-laundering checks; or
                in response to a UK court order. Foreign legal requirements are
                not automatically sufficient to justify disclosure or other
                processing of personal data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Processing is justified if it is necessary for the performance
                of a contract with the data subject or to take steps at the data
                subject s request with a view to entering into such a contract.
                This will justify some processing of personal data relating to
                individual customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Processing can be justified on the basis of data subject
                consent. Our customer contracts should, therefore, include
                consents to the processing of individual customer data that will
                be necessary as part of our Customer and/or Transaction
                Management procedures.
              </p>
              <p>
                The requirement that personal data should be processed lawfully
                can be breached in a number of circumstances, not covered by
                this Policy because in themselves they fall outside the scope of
                the GDPR - for example, processing for fraudulent purposes would
                be unlawful and would therefore breach the GDPR.
              </p>
              <p>
                The GDPR also prohibits the processing of excessive, irrelevant
                or inadequate personal data. Systems and procedures should be
                designed so as not to collect personal data which are excessive
                or irrelevant (in particular: personal data should not be
                collected on a “just-in-case” basis) and, of course, you should
                ensure that the data collected are adequate for the relevant
                purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Personal data collected for any given purpose should not then be
                used for a purpose which is incompatible with that purpose - we
                would not expect this to be an issue in the ordinary course of
                Customer and/or Transaction Management, however.
                <br />
                We expect the general requirement that processing of personal
                data should be fair to be met if all the other requirements of
                this Policy are met.
              </p>

              <h5>TRANSPARENCY/INFORMATION-PROVISION</h5>
              <p>
                We are required under the GDPR to ensure that data subjects have
                various information readily available to them. This requirement
                is subject to exceptions, however, and these exceptions are of
                relatively wide application in the context of Customer and/or
                Transaction Management. In particular, (a) information only
                needs to be made available where it is practicable to do so; (b)
                in the case of personal data which are not collected directly
                from the data subject (for example, payee data collected from a
                payer customer), we are not obliged to provide information if to
                do so would involve disproportionate effort; and (c) we take the
                view that we can assume that data subjects have, and need not
                therefore make available, information which should reasonably be
                obvious to them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The information to be made available is (a) our identity; (b)
                the purposes for which we expect to process the data; and (c)
                any further information that needs to be provided to ensure that
                our processing of the data is fair.
              </p>
              <p>
                We must ensure that our customer contracts inform our individual
                customers of the following:our identity; <br />
                the purposes for which we process their information (including
                know-your-client and related compliance purposes as well as the
                execution of transactions and customer management generally);
                and the following further information, which, we consider, needs
                to be provided to ensure that our processing of customer data is
                fair:
                <br />
                the categories of person to whom we may disclose customer data
                (including, for example, non-customer payers and payees;
                aggregators; any persons with whom we might share data for fraud
                prevention purposes; and regulatory and prosecuting
                authorities);
                <br />
                the fact that, if payments are made to persons outside the
                European Economic Area, this may involve transfers of the
                customer s personal data to jurisdictions which do not have data
                protection laws as strict as those in the UK; and <br />
                information as to the customer s rights of access and correction
                under the GDPR, and contact details so that they can contact the
                Data Protection Officer if they want to exercise those rights
                Our customer contracts should also require customers to pass
                this information on to any individuals whose personal data they
                provide to us.
              </p>
              <p>
                We take the view that we do not need to provide information to
                data subjects other than individual customers to justify our
                processing of their personal data for routine Customer and/or
                Transaction Management purposes. In particular:
              </p>
              <p>
                We take the view that the effort involved in contacting an
                individual non-customer payer or payee, whose personal data are
                given to us by a customer, in order to provide him or her with
                information about our processing of his or her personal data,
                would be disproportionate given that we process his or her
                information only in order to facilitate a transaction of which
                he or she will in any case be aware.
              </p>
              <p>
                We take the same view in relation to individual representatives
                of our customers - having required our customers to pass the
                required information on to their representatives we take the
                view that the effort involved in contacting the representatives
                directly would be disproportionate.

              <p>
                We must have in place appropriate technical and organisational
                security measures to protect the personal data that we process
                for Customer and/or Transaction Management purposes against
                unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss,
                destruction or damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                We need to identify the particular security measures that are
                “appropriate” in the context of our business. They must deliver
                a level of security which is appropriate to the nature of the
                data and the risks associated with unauthorised or unlawful
                processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage. We must,
                in particular, take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability

              <p>
                If any aspect of our processing of personal data for Customer
                and/or Transaction Management purposes is outsourced to a third
                party service provider, including the outsourcing of any wider
                function which includes the processing of personal data, we must
                be assured that the service provider will have appropriate
                technical and organisational security measures in place as
                discussed in paragraphs above ; <br />
                ensure that the arrangement is governed by a written agreement
                which requires the service provider to process the data only on
                our instructions and imposes on the service provider obligations
                equivalent to our obligations as set out in paragraphs above;
                and
              </p>
              <p>
                while the arrangement is in place, take reasonable steps from
                time to time to ensure that the service provider is meeting its
                security obligations in practice.
              </p>

              <p>
                We must delete personal data when we no longer need them, given
                the purposes for which they are processed. This does not, for
                example, prevent us from keeping records containing personal
                data which may be relevant if there is a future dispute with a
                customer or another person, but it does require us to delete
                those records when a dispute is no longer a real possibility
                unless we have another legitimate purpose for continuing to keep
                the personal data.

              </p>
              <p>
                The GDPR s definition of “sensitive personal data” covers

              <p>
                The GDPR s restrictions on the use of automated decision-taking
                cover systems which make decisions which significantly affect
                individuals solely on the basis of the automated processing of
                their personal data, without any human intervention. Examples
                would be the use of automated credit-scoring tools to pre-screen
                credit applications and the use of automated tools to pre-screen
                applications for employment. Semi-automated systems, where the
                ultimate decision is made or reviewed by a human being, are not
                caught by these rules.
